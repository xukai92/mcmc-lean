# Overall project roadmap

This roadmap integrates the two paper targets, executable sampler work, and
the broader [algorithm scope review](algorithm-scope-review.md). It is the
canonical ordering document; paper-specific roadmaps continue to record exact
claim repairs and theorem dependencies.

## Current position

The repository is already deep in three areas:

1. general-state MH, HMC, coupling, meeting-time, and unbiased-estimator
   mathematics;
2. corrected theorem coverage for Xu et al. (2021) and Xu and Ge (2024); and
3. generated executable finite MH, RWMH, endpoint HMC, unit/constant-metric
   multinomial HMC, and the Xu et al. coupled mixture, with explicit
   numerical-refinement boundaries.

The reusable surface combines mathlib composition with local invariant
mixtures, product/lift/project machinery, coupling marginals, finite/infinite
path semantics, and the completed elementary finite combinators.

## Track A: reusable sampler foundations

### A1. Consolidate kernel combinators and add finite Gibbs — complete

- inventoried and publicly re-exported composition, mixture, product,
  mapping, and stationary-marginal theorems;
- added the missing coordinate-lift and deterministic/random scan lemmas;
- defined finite product-state conditional laws, one-site/block Gibbs kernels,
  random scans, and systematic scans; and
- proved target invariance, while keeping irreducibility and convergence as
  separate optional theorems.

This supplies shared language for tempering, adaptation, particle methods,
and coupled multi-kernel algorithms.

### A2. Parallel tempering — complete for two finite temperatures

Coordinate-lifted invariant kernels and an ordinary MH transposition preserve
the two-temperature product target; its cold marginal is identified exactly.
No improved-mixing claim is made.

### A3. Finite pseudo-marginal MH — complete

A nonnegative unbiased estimator on a finite auxiliary space defines the
normalized extended target and an MH transition retaining the current
estimator on rejection. The desired marginal is proved, including zero
estimator values. MCWM remains explicitly separate.

### A4. First general-state convergence and proposal clients -- in progress

The bounded-weight independence-MH `1 / M` minorization and exact residual
decomposition are machine checked. The finite-time geometric bound remains to
be derived from that decomposition before this becomes a quantitative
convergence theorem.

The state-dependent Gaussian proposal is complete. ULA is a Markov kernel
with no target-exactness claim; its MH completion, MALA, is proved Markov,
reversible, and target-invariant. Roberts--Tweedie tail conditions and
geometric-ergodicity results remain a later convergence layer.

## Track B: paper-target execution

### B1. Executable Xu et al. (2021) coupling — complete

Version-9 shared-randomness commands cover coupled multinomial HMC, sticky
Gaussian RWMH, and their mixture. Lean proves both ideal marginals equal the
verified single-chain kernels, and Julia exposes replay-level meeting events.

### B2. Executable Xu and Ge (2024) sampler

Implement the corrected radial/spherical momentum construction,
inverse-factor transport, and nonseparable multinomial transition. Approximate
implicit solves must return residual or integrator certificates consumed by
the existing conditional theorem; a fixed iteration count is insufficient.

## Track C: later breadth branches

After A1--A4 and the paper execution milestones, select branches based on
research value and shared infrastructure:

- NUTS finite candidate trees before adaptation or modern multinomial NUTS;
- slice sampling via lift--update--project;
- reversible-jump MCMC after tagged-space change of variables;
- particle MCMC after finite SMC and pseudo-marginal foundations;
- adaptive MCMC only with explicit nonhomogeneous-chain semantics,
  diminishing adaptation, and containment; and
- BPS/Zig-Zag only in a separate continuous-time PDMP architecture.

Sequence-parallel evaluation is an execution-refinement project downstream of
exact seeded trace semantics. Full solver convergence may refine a sequential
trace; numerical tolerance and early stopping remain separate bias
obligations.

## Immediate plan

A1--A3 and B1 are complete. A4 now has its independence-MH minorization and
MALA/ULA proposal clients; its next obligation is the explicit geometric
independence-MH bound. The next paper-execution branch is B2. Neither is needed
to support the completed finite Gibbs, tempering, pseudo-marginal, or Xu et al.
coupling claims.
